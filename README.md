# Turn your 404 Error Page Redirections into Search Results
This Script Redirects the current page/blog to another Blog/Site or same Blog/Site. That page will display the search result for the Blog Post Title.

## Note
 This is not a 301 redirection method. Its just for making easy for user to get to that post easily without any problem from a 404 page.

## Benefits

This can be used to convert 404 pages into search results. Read More about Implementation here(Coming Soon).
##### This can also be used for redirecting to same domain.

## What Really Happens Here?

1)Fetching the last part of URL of Site A.

2)Clean it. Remove all unwanted hyphens and replace it with search.

3)Optional : Remove the extension .html from the string.

4)Take this formatted string to site B's search and make it a search.
(In Most Cases the results will be narrowed as URL is being chopped out.)
